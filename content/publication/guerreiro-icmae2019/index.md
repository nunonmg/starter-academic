abstract: This paper deals with the implementation of a Cascaded Incremental Backstepping (IBS) control law for a Boeing 747, in order to establish a comparison with the predominant flight control design methodology for commercial airplanes - Gain Scheduling. Both attitude and rate control laws will be determined using incremental dynamics, and the airspeed will be included in the rate controller so as to combine the usage of the control surfaces and engine thrust to solve the attitude and airspeed tracking problem. A stability analysis is provided based on Lyapunov theory considering the influence of external disturbances, the incremental dynamics and the higher-order terms of the Taylor series expansion that are neglected to derive the incremental control law. Numerical simulations show that the IBS control law provides more robustness to severe external disturbances while requiring less model knowledge and being easier to implement. These results show the great potential of using IBS control laws in commercial aviation.
